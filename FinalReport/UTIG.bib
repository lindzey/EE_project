@article{Hand2007,
abstract = {Europa is a prime target for astrobiology. The presence of a global subsurface liquid water ocean and a composition likely to contain a suite of biogenic elements make it a compelling world in the search for a second origin of life. Critical to these factors, however, may be the availability of energy for biological processes on Europa. We have examined the production and availability of oxidants and carbon-containing reductants on Europa to better understand the habitability of the subsurface ocean. Data from the Galileo Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer were used to constrain the surface abundance of CO(2) to 0.036{\%} by number relative to water. Laboratory results indicate that radiolytically processed CO(2)-rich ices yield CO and H(2)CO(3); the reductants H(2)CO, CH(3)OH, and CH(4) are at most minor species. We analyzed chemical sources and sinks and concluded that the radiolytically processed surface of Europa could serve to maintain an oxidized ocean even if the surface oxidants (O(2), H(2)O(2), CO(2), SO(2), and SO(4) (2)) are delivered only once every approximately 0.5 Gyr. If delivery periods are comparable to the observed surface age (30-70 Myr), then Europa's ocean could reach O(2) concentrations comparable to those found in terrestrial surface waters, even if approximately 10(9) moles yr(1) of hydrothermally delivered reductants consume most of the oxidant flux. Such an ocean would be energetically hospitable for terrestrial marine macrofauna. The availability of reductants could be the limiting factor for biologically useful chemical energy on Europa.},

abstract = {Airborne radar sounding is an established tool for observing the bed conditions and subglacial hydrology of ice sheets and glaciers. The specularity content of radar bed echoes has also been used to detect the hydrologic transition of a subglacial water system from a network of distributed canals to a network of concentrated channels beneath the Thwaites Glacier. However, the physical dimensions of the distributed water bodies in these networks have not been constrained by observations. In this letter, we use a variety of simple radar scattering, attenuation, and cross- sectional models to provide a first estimate of the subglacial water body geometries capable of producing the observed anisotropic specularity of the Thwaites Glacier catchment. This approach leads to estimates of ice/water interface root mean square rough- nesses less than about 15 cm, thicknesses ofmore than about 5 cm, lengths of more than about 15 m, and widths between about 0.5 and 5 m.},

@article{Glasser2011,
abstract = {We use optical (ASTER and Landsat) and radar (ERS-1 and ERS-2) satellite$\backslash$nimagery to document changes in the Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Antarctic$\backslash$nPeninsula, and its tributary glaciers before and after its January$\backslash$n1995 collapse. The satellite image record captures the transition$\backslash$nfrom an ice-shelf glacier system to a tidewater glacial system and$\backslash$nthe subsequent rapid retreat and inferred `fatal' negative mass balances$\backslash$nthat occur as lower glacier elevations lead to higher ablation and$\backslash$ntidewater-style calving collapse. Pre-1995 images show that the central$\backslash$nice shelf was fed primarily by Sjogren Glacier flowing from the Antarctic$\backslash$nPeninsula and by Rohss Glacier flowing from James Ross Island. Numerous$\backslash$nstructural discontinuities (rifts and crevasses) and melt ponds were$\backslash$npresent on the ice shelf before the collapse. After the ice shelf$\backslash$ncollapsed, Rohss Glacier retreated rapidly, becoming a tidewater$\backslash$nglacier in 2002 and receding a total of similar to 15 km between$\backslash$nJanuary 2001 and March 2009, losing >70{\%} of its area. Topographic$\backslash$nprofiles of Rohss Glacier from ASTER-derived digital elevation models$\backslash$nshow a thinning of up to 150 m, and surface speeds increased up to$\backslash$nninefold (0.1-0.9 m d(-1)) over the same period. The rates of speed$\backslash$nincrease and elevation loss, however, are not monotonic; both rates$\backslash$nslowed between late 2002 and 2005, accelerated in 2006 and slowed$\backslash$nagain in 2008-09. We conclude that tributary glaciers react to ice-shelf$\backslash$nremoval by rapid (if discontinuous) recession, and that the response$\backslash$nof tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula to ice-shelf removal$\backslash$noccurs over timescales ranging from sub-annual to decadal.},

abstract = {The Glen exponent n characterizes the stress-dependence$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof ice deformation, directly influencing the rate at which ice masses respond to external forcing. The slow deformation$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin large ice-sheets makes laboratory rheometry at representative strain-rates difficult. We develop a new technique to estimate n in-situ, deploying a phase-sensitive radar to measure vertical strain rates of around 104 yr1 within the top 1000 m of ice across ice divides at Summit and NEEM, Greenland. A fluid-dynamical feature, the Raymond Effect, predicts strong vertical strain-rate variation across divides over distances of a few ice-thicknesses. We achieve sufficient resolution to show this pattern, enabling us to estimate n = 4.5 by inverting our observations with flow modelling. This is higher than values previously used but consistent with other indirect measurements, implying laboratory measurements do not explore the full range of ice rheology and the consequent possibility of a greater sensitivity and responsiveness$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin ice-sheet dynamics.},

abstract = {A computationally efficient relocatable system for generalized inverse (GI) modeling of barotropic ocean tides is described. The GI penalty functional is minimized using a representer method, which requires repeated solution of the forward and adjoint linearized shallow water equations (SWEs). To make representer computations efficient, the SWEs are solved in the frequency domain by factoring the coefficient matrix for a finite-difference discretization of the second-order wave equation in elevation. Once this matrix is factored representers can be calculated rapidly. By retaining the first-order SWE system (defined in terms of both elevations and currents) in the definition of the discretized GI penalty functional, complete generality in the choice of dynamical error covariances is retained. This allows rational assumptions about errors in the SWE, with soft momentum balance constraints (e. g., to account for inaccurate parameterization of dissipation), but holds mass conservation constraints. While the dynamical calculations involve elevations alone, depth-averaged currents can be directly assimilated into the tidal model with this approach. The efficient representer calculation forms the basis for the Oregon State University (OSU) Tidal Inversion Software (OTIS). OTIS includes software for generating grids, prior model covariances, and boundary conditions; for time stepping the nonlinear shallow water equations to generate a first guess or prior solution; for preliminary processing of TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter data; for solution of the GI problem; and for computation of posterior error bars. Approximate GI solution methods, based on using a reduced set of representers, allow very large datasets to be inverted. OTIS regional and local GI tidal modeling (with grids containing up to 10(5) nodes) require only a few hours on a common desktop workstation. Use of OTIS is illustrated by developing a new regional-scale (1/68) model of tides in the Indonesian Seas.},

@article{Thomas2007,
abstract = {Recent observations showing substantial diurnal changes in velocities of glaciers flowing into the ocean, measured at locations far inland of glacier grounding lines, add fuel to the ongoing debate concerning the ability of glaciers to transmit longitudinal-stress perturbations over large distances. Resolution of this debate has major implications for the prediction of glacier mass balance, because it determines how rapidly a glacier can respond dynamically to changes such as weakening or removal of an ice shelf. Current IPCC assessment of sea-level rise takes little account of such changes, on the assumption that dynamic responses would be too slow to have any appreciable effect on ice discharge fluxes. However, this assumption must be questioned in view of observations showing massive increases in glacier velocities following removal of parts of the Larsen Ice Shelf, Antarctica, and of others showing diurnal velocity changes apparently linked to the tides. Here, I use a simple force-perturbation model to calculate the response of glacier strain rates to tidal rise and fall, assuming associated longitudinal-force perturbations are transmitted swiftly far inland of the glacier grounding line. Results show reasonable agreement with observations from an Alaskan glacier, where the velocity changes extended only a short distance up-glacier. However, for larger Antarctic glaciers, big velocity changes extending far upstream cannot be explained by this mechanism, unless ice-shelf "back forces" change substantially with the tides. Additional insight will require continuous measurement of velocity and strain-rate profiles along flow lines of glaciers and ice shelves. An example is suggested, involving continuous GPS measurements at a series of locations along the centre line of Glaciar San Rafael, Chile, extending from near the calving front to perhaps 20??km inland. Tidal range here is about ?? 0.8??m, which should be sufficient to cause a variation in ice-front velocity of ?? 2??cm h- 1 about its average value of 75??cm h- 1, assuming local seawater depth of 150??m and glacier thickness of 200-400??m. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The glacial history of Antarctica during the most recent Milankovitch cycles is poorly constrained relative to the Northern Hemisphere. As a consequence, the contribution of mass changes in the Antarctic ice sheet to global sea-level change and the prediction of its future evolution remain uncertain. The process of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) represents the ongoing response of the solid Earth to the Late-Pleistocene deglaciation and, therefore, provides information about Antarctic glacial history. Moreover, insufficient knowledge of GIA hampers the determination of present-day changes in the Antarctic mass balance through satellite gravity measurements. Previous studies have laid the theoretical foundation for distinguishing between signals of ongoing GIA and contemporary ice mass change through the combination of satellite gravimetry and satellite altimetry. This distinction is made possible by the fact the GIA-induced changes (involving relatively dense rock) will produce a different combination of topography and gravity change than those produced by variations in ice or firn thickness (due to the lower density of these materials); however, no conclusive results have been produced to date. Here we show that, by combining laser altimetry and gravity data from the ICESat and GRACE satellite missions over the period March 2003-March 2008, the GIA contribution can indeed be isolated. The inferred GIA signal over the Antarctic continent, which represents the first result derived from direct observations by satellite techniques, strongly supports Late-Pleistocene ice models derived from glacio-geologic studies. The GIA impact on GRACE-derived estimates of mass balance is found to be 100 ?? 67 Gt/yr. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We demonstrate that these observations can be explained by accelerations initiated up to 12km closer to the margin where the ice is {\$}40{\%} thinner, is heavily crevassed, experiences a seasonal doubling of velocity, and where the ablation rate, surface meltwater flux and ice temperature are likely higher. Our modeling and observations suggest that conditions and processes normally found near ice-sheet margins are adequate for explaining the observations of Zwally and others (2002). This and considerations of the likely subglacial hydrology in the marginal zone lead us to suggest that seasonal accelerations may have limited impact on ice-sheet mass balance even in the face of climate warming.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A biocybernetic system has been developed as a method to evaluate automated flight deck concepts for compatibility with human capabilities. A biocybernetic loop is formed by adjusting the mode of operation of a task set (e.g., manual/automated mix) based on electroencephalographic (EEG) signals reflecting an operator's engagement in the task set. A critical issue for the loop operation is the selection of features of the EEG to provide an index of engagement upon which to base decisions to adjust task mode. Subjects were run in the closed-loop feedback configuration under four candidate and three experimental control definitions of an engagement index. The temporal patterning of system mode switching was observed for both positive and negative feedback of the index. The indices were judged on the basis of their relative strength in exhibiting expected feedback control system phenomena (stable operation under negative feedback and unstable operation under positive feedback). Of the candidate indices evaluated in this study, an index constructed according to the formula, beta power/(alpha power + theta power), reflected task engagement best.},

abstract = {The downstream portion of Whillans Ice Stream, West Antarctica, moves primarily by stick-slip motion. The observation of stick-slip motion suggests that the bed is governed by velocity-weakening physics and that the basal physics is more unstable than suggested by laboratory studies. The stick-slip cycle of Whillans Ice Plain exhibits substantial variability in both the duration of sticky periods and in slip magnitude. To understand this variability, we modeled the forces acting on the ice stream during the stick phase of the stick-slip cycle. The ocean tides introduce changes in the rate at which stress is applied to the ice plain. Increased loading rates promote earlier failure and vice versa. Results show that the bed of Whillans Ice Stream strengthens over time (healing) during the quiescent intervals in the stick-slip cycle, with the bed weakening during slip events. The time-dependent strengthening of the ice plain bed following termination of slip events indicates that the strength of the bed may vary by up to 0.35 kPa during the course of a single day.},

abstract = {Tides near and under floating glacial ice, such as ice shelves and glacier termini in fjords, can influence heat transport into the subice cavity, mixing of the under-ice water column, and the calving and subsequent drift of icebergs. Free-surface displacement patterns associated with ocean variability below glacial ice can be observed by differencing two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms, each of which represents the combination of the displacement patterns associated with the time-varying vertical motion and the time-independent lateral ice flow. We present the pattern of net free-surface displacement for the iceberg calving regions of the Ronne and Filchner Ice Shelves in the southern Weddell Sea. By comparing SAR-based displacement fields with ocean tidal models, the free-surface displacement variability for these regions is found to be dominated by ocean tides. The inverse barometer effect, i.e., the ocean's isostatic response to changing atmospheric pressure, also contributes to the observed vertical displacement. The principal value of using SAR interferometry in this manner lies in the very high lateral resolution (tens of meters) obtained over the large region covered by each SAR image. Small features that are not well resolved by the typical grid spacing of ocean tidal models may contribute to such processes as iceberg calving and cross-frontal ventilation of the ocean cavity under the ice shelf.},

abstract = {A large portion of the recent increase in the rate of mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is from increased outlet glacier discharge along its southeastern margin. While previous investigations of the region's two largest glaciers suggest that acceleration is a dynamic response to thinning and retreat of the calving front, it is unknown whether this mechanism can explain regional acceleration and what forcing is responsible for initiating rapid thinning and retreat. We examine seasonal and interannual changes in ice-front position, surface elevation and flow speed for 32 glaciers along the southeastern coast between 2000 and 2006. While substantial seasonality in front position and speed is apparent, nearly all the observed glaciers show net retreat, thinning and acceleration, with speed-up corresponding to retreat. The ratio of retreat to the along-flow stress-coupling length is proportional to the relative increase in speed, consistent with typical ice-flow and sliding laws. This affirms that speed-up results from loss of resistive stress at the front during retreat, which leads to along-flow stress transfer. Large retreats were often preceded by the formation of a flat or reverse-sloped surface near the front, indicating that subsequent retreats were influenced by the reversed bed slope. Many retreats began with an increase in thinning rates near the front in the summer of 2003, a year of record high coastal-air and sea-surface temperatures. This anomaly was driven in part by recent warming, suggesting that episodes of speed-up and retreat may become more common in a warmer climate.},

@article{Walter2012,
abstract = {Dynamics of marine-terminating major outlet glaciers are of high interest because of their potential for drawing down large areas of the Greenland ice sheet. We quantify short-term changes in ice flow speed and calving at a major West Greenland glacier and examine their relationship to the presence of the sea-ice melange and tidal stage. A field campaign at the terminus of Store Gletscher (70.408 N, 50.558 W) spanning the spring and summer of 2008 included four broadband seismometers, three time-lapse cameras, a tide gauge, an automatic weather station and an on-ice continuous GPS station. Sub-daily fluctuations in speed coincide with two modes of oceanic forcing: (1) the removal of the ice melange from the terminus front and (2) tidal fluctuations contributing to speed increases following ice melange removal. Tidal fluctuations in ice flow speed were observed 16km from the terminus and possibly extend further. Seismic records suggest that periods of intensive calving activity coincide with ice-flow acceleration following breakup of the melange in spring. A synchronous increase in speed at the front and clearing of the melange suggests that the melange directly resists ice flow. We estimate a buttressing stress (3060 kPa) due to the presence of the ice melange that is greater than expected from the range of observed tides, though an order of magnitude less than the driving stress. 1. INTRODUCTION Recent evidence suggests that the dynamics of Greenland glaciers are highly sensitive to external forcing. In response to the loss of its floating ice tongue, Greenlands largest outlet glacier, Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}, doubled in speed while retreating, thinning and increasing its calving rate (Joughin and others, 2008). Helheim Glacier also experienced similar dynamic thinning and increases in speed along its main trunk, in response to retreat of the ice front (Howat and others, 2005). During the acceleration, the annual mass loss nearly doubled in 2004, but within a 2 year period (2006) decreased to near-previous rates, likely due to stabilization of flow near the terminus (Howat and others, 2007). The results suggest that ice dynamics, manifested in flow speed, glacier thickness adjustments and calving, are closely linked, with the ability to vary rapidly. Furthermore, grounded ice is likely sensitive to changes occurring at the terminus. If ice dynamics can change rapidly in response to a warming climate, such changes may be directly related to ice/ocean interactions. Some of these changes may be driven by long-term oceanic warming present in the waters surrounding Greenland; one notable observation indicates an incursion of warm water around 1997 offshore of Jakobshavn Isbr{\ae}, which may have contributed to calving of its floating ice tongue and doubling in speed (Holland and others, 2008). Further evidence from within fjords in southeast Greenland suggests that wind-driven exchange at the continental shelf drives subtropical waters into fjords, creating a circulation which brings warmer waters into fjords and increases melting at the terminus (Straneo and others, 2010). Local fjord-scale tidal pumping can be another important heat delivery mechanism to consider (Mortensen and others, 2011). A pervasive presence of warmer waters},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Abstract The application of a generalized inverse approach for assimilating vessel-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (VM-ADCP) data into numerical solutions of barotropic tides is described. The derived estimates of tidal currents can be used to detide the VM-ADCP data and expose underlying mean circulation. The methodology is illustrated with data assimilation models of tidal currents in the Ross Sea. The prior solution, obtained by solving the nonlinear shallow-water equations by time stepping with a linear bottom friction parameterization and elevation of open boundary conditions obtained from a circum-Antarctic tide model, provides reasonably good fit to most available moored current meter data. Two inverse solutions were obtained: one assimilating moored current meter records and the other assimilating three cruises of VM-ADCP data. Fitting either the mooring time series or the VM-ADCP records leads to only small changes relative to the prior solution currents, except over the shelf break whe...},

abstract = {The inverse barometer effect (IBE) is the isostatic response of ocean surface helght to changes in atmospheric pressure (P-air) at a rate of about 1 cm hPa(-1). The IBE is a significant contributor to variability of ice-shelf surface elevation (eta(icc)), as we demonstrate with simultaneous global positioning system measurements of eta(ice) and local measurements of P-air from the Amery, Brunt and Ross Ice Shelves, Antarctica. We find that all IBE correction is justified for frequencies (w) covering the "weather hand", 0.03 < w < 0.5 cpd (cycles per day). The IBE correction reduces the standard deviation of the weather-band signal of eta(ice) from similar to9 cm to similar to3 cm. With this correction, the largest remaining high-frequency error signal in eta(ice) is the inaccuracy of the present generation of Antarctic tide models, estimated to be of order 10 cm for most of Antarctica.},

abstract = {The tidally modulated, stick-slip events of Whillans Ice StreaminWest Antarctica produce seismic energy from three locations near the grounding line. Using ice velocity records obtained by combining time series from colocated broadband seismometers and GPS receivers installed on the ice stream during the 2010–2011 and 2011–2012 austral summers, along with far-field seismic recordings of elastic waves, we locate regions of high rupture velocity and stress drop. These regions,which are analogous to “asperities” in traditional seismic fault studies, are areas of elevated friction at the base of the ice stream. Slip events consistently initiate at one of two locations: near the center of the ice stream, where events associated with the Ross Sea high tide originate, or a grounding-line spot, where events associated with the Ross Sea low tide initiate, as well as occasional high-tide events following a skipped low-tide event. The grounding-line site, but not the central site, produces Rayleigh waves observable up to 1000 kmaway, through fast expansion of the slip area. Grounding-line initiation events also show strong directivity in the downstream direction, indicating initial rupture propagation at 1.5km/s, compared to an average of 0.150km/s for the entire slip event. Following slip initiation, additional seismic energy is produced from two sources located near the grounding line: first at the downstream end of Subglacial Lake Engelhardt and second toward the farthest downstream extent of the ice stream. This evidence suggests that the stronger, higher-friction material along the grounding line controls motion throughout the stick-slip region.},

Overall, average ice-shelf volume change accelerated from negligible loss at 25+– 64 cubic kilometers per year for 1994–2003 to rapid loss of 310+– 74 cubic kilometers per year for 2003–2012.

We have refined an existing method and used additional in$\backslash$nsitu measurements to estimate the cavity shape under the Amery Ice$\backslash$nShelf, East Antarctica. A finite-element hydrodynamic ocean-tide$\backslash$nmodel was used to simulate the major tidal constituents for a range$\backslash$nof different sub-Amery Ice Shelf cavity water-column thicknesses.$\backslash$nThe data are adjusted in the largely unsurveyed southern region of$\backslash$nthe ice-shelf cavity by comparing the complex error between simulated$\backslash$ntides and in situ tides, derived from GPS observations. We show a$\backslash$nsignificant improvement in the simulated tides, with a combined complex$\backslash$nerror of 1.8 cm, in comparison with past studies which show a complex$\backslash$nerror of {\&}{\#}8764;5.3 cm. Our bathymetry incorporates ice-draft data$\backslash$nat the grounding line and seismic surveys, which have provided a$\backslash$nconsiderable amount of new data. This technique has particular application$\backslash$nwhen the water column beneath ice shelves is inaccessible and in$\backslash$nsitu GPS data are available.},

abstract = {The melting of tidewater outlet glaciers from the Greenland Ice Sheet contributes significantly to global sea level rise. Accelerated mass loss is related to melt processes in front of calving glaciers, yet the role of ocean heat transports is poorly understood. Here we present the first direct measurements from a subglacial plume in front of a calving tidewater outlet glacier. Surface salinity in the plume corresponded to a meltwater content of 7{\%}, which is indicative of significant entrainment of warm bottom water and, according to plume model calculations, significant ice melt. Energy balance of the area near the glacier showed that ice melt was mainly due to ocean heat transport and that direct plume-associated melt was only important in periods with high meltwater discharge rates of {\~{}}100 m3 s−1. Ocean mixing outside of the plume area was thus the primary heat source for melting glacier ice.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = { {\{}{\{}[{\}}1] The interpretation of radar sounding data from Mars where$\backslash$nsignificant topographic relief occurs will require echo source discrimination$\backslash$nto avoid the misinterpretation of surface echoes as arising from$\backslash$nthe subsurface. This can be accomplished through the identification$\backslash$nof all radar returns from the surface in order to positively identify$\backslash$nsubsurface echoes. We have developed general techniques for this$\backslash$nusing airborne radar data from the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. These$\backslash$ndata were collected in a single pass, including Taylor Glacier, ice-covered$\backslash$nLake Bonney, and an ice-free area of Taylor Valley. The pulsed radar$\backslash$n(52.5-67.5 MHz) was coherently recorded. Our echo discrimination$\backslash$ntechniques included a radar simulator using a digital elevation model$\backslash$n(DEM) to predict the location and shape of surface echoes in the$\backslash$nradar data. Real and simulated echo strengths were used to calculate$\backslash$na signal-to-clutter ratio. This was complemented by the cross-track$\backslash$nmigration of radar echoes onto the surface. These migrated echoes$\backslash$nwere superimposed on the DEM and imagery in order to correlate with$\backslash$nsurface features. Using these techniques enabled us to identify a$\backslash$nnumber of echoes in the radar data as arising from the surface and$\backslash$nto identify subsurface echoes, including a continuous reflector under$\backslash$nthe main trunk of Taylor Glacier and multiple reflectors beneath$\backslash$nthe terminus of Taylor Glacier. Surface-based radar confirms the$\backslash$nthickness of the glacier at three crossing points. The results illustrate$\backslash$nthe importance of using complementary techniques, the usefulness$\backslash$nof a DEM, and the limitations of single-pass radar sounding data.{\}}},

abstract = {Based on observations of the 1982-1983 surge of Varigated Glacier, Alaska, a model of the surge mechanism is developed in terms of a transition from the normal tunnel configuration of the basal water conduit system to alinked cavity configuration that tends to restrict the flow of water, resulting in increased basal water pressure that cause rapid basal sliding. The linked cavity system consists of basal cavities formed by ice-bedlock separation (cavitation), {\~{}}1 m high and {\~{}}10 m in horizontal dimensions, widely scattered over the glacier bed, and hydraulically linked by narrow connections where separation is minimal (separation gap <= 0.1 m). The narrow connections, called orifices, control the water flow through the conuit system; the throttling the flow through the large cavities, the orificies keep the water flux transmitted by hte vasal water system at normal levels even though the total cavity cross-sectional area ({\~{}}200 m2) is much larger than that of a tunnel system. A physical model of the linked cavity system is formulated in terms of the dimensions of the typical cavity and orifice and the number of these across the glacier width. The model concentrates on the detailed configuration of the typical orifices and its response to basal water pressure and basal sliding, which determines the water flux carried by the system under given donditions.},

abstract = {Aeromagnetic surveys, spaced less than or equal to 5 km, over widely separated areas of the largely ice- and sea-covered West Antarctic rift system, reveal similar patterns of 100- to 1700- nT, shallow-source magnetic anomalies interpreted as evidence of extensive late Cenozoic volcanism. We use the aeromagnetic data to extend the volcanic rift interpretation over West Antarctica starting with anomalies over (1) exposures of highly magnetic, late Cenozoic volcanic rocks several kilometers thick in the McMurdo-Ross Island area and elsewhere; continuing through (2) volcanoes and subvolcanic intrusions directly beneath the Ross Sea continental shelf defined by marine magnetic and seismic reflection data and aeromagnetic data and (3) volcanic structures interpreted beneath the Ross Ice Shelf partly controlled by seismic reflection determinations of seafloor depth to (4) an area of similar magnetic pattern over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (400 lan from the nearest exposed volcanic rock), where interpretations of late Cenozoic volcanic rocks at the base of the ice are controlled in part by radar ice sounding, North trending magnetic rift fabric in the Ross Sea-Ross Ice Shelf and Corridor Aerogeophysics of the Southeast Ross Transect Zone (CASERTZ) areas, revealed by the aeromagnetic surveys, is probably a reactivation of older rift trends Gate Mesozoic?) and is superimposed on still older crosscutting structural trends revealed by magnetic terrace maps calculated from horizontal gradient of pseudogravity. Long wavelength (similar to 100-km wide) magnetic terraces from sources within the subvolcanic basement cross the detailed survey areas. One of these extends across the Ross Sea survey from the front of the Transantarctic Mountains with an east- southeast trend crossing the north trending rift fabric. The Ross Sea-Ross Ice Shelf sun ey area is characterized by highly magnetic northern and southern zones which are separated by magnetically defined faults from a more moderately magnetic central zone. Aeromagnetic data in the south delineate the Ross fault of unknown age. The extension of the southern Central Basin south of the Ross fault is associated with an 825-nT magnetic anomaly over the Ross Ice Shelf requiring inferred late Cenozoic volcanic rock essentially at the seafloor at its south end, as shown by magnetic models. Models show that the thickness of magnetic volcanic rocks beneath Hut Point Peninsula at McMurdo Station is probably <2 km. The detailed surveys, combined with data from >100,000 km of widely spaced aeromagnetic profiles, led to the interpretation of the mostly subglacial West Antarctic flood basalts(?) or their subglacially erupted and intruded equivalent. The volume of the exposed volcanos is small in contrast to the much greater volume (>10(6) km(3)) of late Cenozoic magnetic rock remaining at volcanic centers beneath the continental shelf, Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctic Ice Sheet. We suggest as an alternative or supplemental explanation to the previously proposed mantle plume hypothesis for the late Cenozoic volcanism significantly greater lower lithosphere (mantle) stretching resulting in greater decompression melting than the limited Cenozoic crustal extension allows. However, this implies a space problem that is not obviously resolved, because the Antarctic Plate is essentially surrounded by spreading centers.},

The focus on firms rather than people has been challenged by Florida arguing that urban amenities attract creative people to certain cities. On the basis of a questionnaire, an analysis is made of the extent to which these two mechanisms affect the locational behaviour of Dutch fashion design entrepreneurs. It is found that fashion design entrepreneurs consider urban amenities to be more important than agglomeration economies for their location decision. Designers located in the Amsterdam cluster do not profit from agglomeration economies as such, but rather from superior networking opportunities with peers both within and outside the cluster.},

abstract = {The circulation and water masses in the region between 80 and 150??E and from the Antarctic continental shelf to the Southern Boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) ({\~{}}62??S) are described from hydrographic and surface drifter data taken as part of the multi-disciplinary experiment, Baseline Research on Oceanography Krill and the Environment (BROKE). Two types of bottom water are identified, Adelie Land Bottom Water, formed locally between 140 and 150??E, and Ross Sea Bottom Water. Ross Sea Bottom Water is found only at 150??E, whereas Adelie Land Bottom Water is found throughout the survey region. The bottom water mass properties become progressively warmer and saltier to the west, suggesting a westward flow. All of the eight meridional CTD sections show an Antarctic Slope Front of varying strength and position with respect to the shelf break. In the water formation areas (between 140 and 150??E) and 104??E, the Antarctic Slope Front is more 'V' shaped, while elsewhere it is one-sided. The shape of the slope front, and the presence or absence of water formation there, are consistent with other meridional sections in the Weddel Sea and simple theories of bottom-water formation (Gill, 1973. Deep-Sea Research 20, 111-140; Whitworth et al., 1998. In: Jacobs and Weiss (Eds.), Ocean, Ice and Atmosphere: Interactions at the Antartic Continental Margin, Antarctic Research Series. American Geophysical Union, Washington, pp. (1-27). ADCP surface velocities and buoy drift tracks show a strong westward flow over the shelf and slope regions. In the region 90-100??E there is a strong eastward flow of the waters just south of the Southern Boundary of the ACC, suggesting a recirculation of the westward slope current and the presence of a weak cyclonic gyre. Using the ADCP velocities as a reference for the CTD data, the average westward transport in this region is 29.4 ?? 14.7 Sv. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Pettit2003,
abstract = {If an ice sheet is frozen to its bed, deep ice directly under a divide experienccs low deviatoric stress and is relatively hard, because the rheology of polar ice is described by a power-law constitutive relation. In steady state, stratigraphic layers tend to form an arch ({\{}''{\}}Raymond bump{\{}''{\}}) in this region. However, when the basal ice can slide, the stresses are redistributed, and longitudinal extension due to sliding is associated with increased deviatoric stress in the deep ice under the divide. This increased deviatoric stress weakens the tendency to form a Raymond bump. To find a realistic spatial distribution of sliding under an ice divide, we incorporate a thin layer of viscous till in a finite-element plane-strain flow model. The resulting basal ``sliding{\{}''{\}} velocity varies approximately linearly with distance from the ice divide. By varying the till viscosity, we can adjust the amount of basal motion. We find that the Raymond bump decays exponentially with the fraction of total ice flux carried by sliding: the arch is 50{\%} smaller when the sliding flux is only 7 {\%} of the total ice flux. This Implies that the possibility of a wet bed must be considered when inferring past ice-divide locations from radar internal layering.},

@article{Juan2010,
abstract = {Large calving events at Greenland's largest outlet glaciers are associated with glacial earthquakes and near-instantaneous increases in glacier flow speed. At some glaciers and ice streams, flow is also modulated in a regular way by ocean tidal forcing at the terminus. At Helheim Glacier, analysis of geodetic data shows decimeter-level periodic position variations in response to tidal forcing. However, we also observe transient increases of more than 100{\%} in the glacier's responsiveness to such tidal forcing following glacial-earthquake calving events. The timing and amplitude of the changes correlate strongly with the step-like increases in glacier speed and longitudinal strain rate associated with glacial earthquakes. The enhanced response to the ocean tides may be explained by a temporary disruption of the subglacial drainage system and a concomitant reduction of the friction at the ice-bedrock interface, and suggests a new means by which geodetic data may be used to infer glacier properties.},

Radar-ice-sounding (RIS) shows the northern part of this pattern overlies the SR, and extends south over the Bentley Subglacial Trench (BST). Modeled sources of all but one the caldera(?) anomalies are at the base of < 1-2-km thick ice and their volcanic edifices have been glacially removed. The exception is a 700-m high, 15-km wide "volcano" producing an 800-nT anomaly over the BST. "Intrusion" of this "volcano" beneath 3 km of ice probably resulted in pillow basalt rather than easily removed hyaloclastite erupted beneath thinner ice. The background area (-300 to -500-nT) surrounding the caldera(?) is possibly caused by a shallow Curie isotherm.},

Pine Island Glacier retreated 31 km at its center, with most retreat in 2005–2009 when the glacier ungrounded from its ice plain. Thwaites Glacier retreated 14 km along its fast flow core and 1 to 9 km along the sides. Haynes Glacier retreated 10 km along its flanks. Smith/Kohler glaciers retreated the most, 35 km along its ice plain, and its ice shelf pinning points are vanishing. These rapid retreats proceed along regions of retrograde bed elevation mapped at a high spatial resolution using a mass conservation technique that removes residual ambiguities from prior mappings. Upstream of the 2011 grounding line positions, we find no major bed obstacle that would prevent the glaciers from further retreat and draw down the entire basin.},

abstract = {The transport of subglacial water beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is an enigmatic and difficult to observe process which may affect the flow of the overlying ice and mixing of the oceans in the sub ice shelf cavities, and ultimately global climate. Periodic outbursts are a critical mechanism in this process. Recent analysis of satellite data has inferred a subglacial hydraulic discharge totaling 2??km
                        3 traveling some 260??km along the ice-bed interface of the Adventure Subglacial Trench between 1996 and 1998 (Wingham et al., 2006. Rapid discharge connects Antarctic subglacial lakes. Nature 440, 1033-1036). Using radar echo sounding data from the Adventure Subglacial Trench region in conjunction with the previously reported satellite observations, along with some basic modeling, we calculate a mass budget and infer a flow mechanism for the 1996-1998 event. The volume released from the source lake exceeded the volume received by the destination lakes by {\~{}} 1.1??km
                        3. This discrepancy indicates that some water must have escaped downstream from the lowest destination lake from 1997 onward. The downstream release of water from the destination lakes continued until at least 2003, several years after the 1998 cessation of surface subsidence at the source lake. By 2003 a total of 1.5??km
                        3 or nearly 75{\%} of the water released by the source lake had traveled downstream from the destination lakes. The temporal evolution of discharge from the outlet can be simulated with the classic ice-walled semicircular channel model, if and only if the retreat of the source lake shoreline is taken into account. Further downstream, the ice bedrock geometry along the inferred flow path downstream includes many sections where thermal erosion of the overlying ice would not be sustainable. Along these reaches mechanical lifting of the ice roof and/or erosion of a sedimentary substrate by a broad shallow water system would be most effective means of sustaining the discharge. A distributed system is also consistent with the 3-month delay between water release at the source lake and water arrival at the destination lake. Observations of intermittent flat bright bed reflections in radar data acquired along the flow path are consistent with the presence of a broad shallow water system. Ultimately the presence of large subglacial lakes along the flow path of the 1996-1998 Adventure Subglacial Trench flow path delayed the arrival of water to points downstream by approximately 12??months. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vario functions are lag-dependent experimental functions introduced to characterize spatial properties of surfaces and profiles in a general algebraic sense and their derivatives. Vario functions of higher order are defined recursively. Under certain mathematical conditions, first-order vario functions coincide with experimental variograms. Vario functions of higher order provide a useful extension of the geostatistical classification method, in particular in the cases of poor signal-to-resolution ratio and in the cases of complex morphogenesis. Several theoretical questions concerning vario functions are investigated: feature detection and quantitative analysis in a situation of poor signal-to-resolution ratio, the divergence criterion for determination of the usable distance range of the second-order vario function, characterization of superimposed features (of the geo-variable) by secondary minima and convexity or concavity of the (second-order) vario function, effects of increasing resolution in vario-function calculation for the study of small-scale features, and the question of homogeneity of a data set. Higher-order vario functions prove essential in the characterization of snow surface roughness, demonstrated for microtopographic data from Niwot Ridge, Colorado Front Range. Application of the geostatistical classification approach to vario functions of higher order leads to conclusions on snow surface morphogenesis and its dependence on environmental and geographical conditions that are not obtainable otherwise. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {The active West Antarctic Rift System, which extends from the continental shelf of the Ross Sea, beneath the Ross Ice Shelf and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is comparable in size to the Basin and Range in North America, or the East African rift systems. Geophysical surveys (primarily marine seismic and aeromagnetic combined with radar ice sounding) have extended the information provided by sparse geologic exposures and a few drill holes over the ice and sea covered area. Rift basins developed in the early Cretaceous accompanied by the major extension of the region. Tectonic activity has continued episodically in the Cenozoic to the present, including major uplift of the Transantarctic Mountains. The West Antarctic ice sheet, and the late Cenozoic volcanic activity in the West Antarctic Rift System, through which it flows, have been coeval since at least Miocene time. The rift is characterized by sparse exposures of late Cenozoic alkaline volcanic rocks extending from northern Victoria Land throughout Marie Byrd Land. The aeromagnetic interpretations indicate the presence of > 5 x 105 km2 (> 106 km3) of probable late Cenozoic volcanic rocks (and associated subvolcanic intrusions) in the West Antarctic rift. This great volume with such limited exposures is explained by glacial removal of the associated late Cenozoic volcanic edifices (probably hyaloclastite debris) concomitantly with their subglacial eruption. Large offset seismic investigations in the Ross Sea and on the Ross Ice Shelf indicate a {\~{}} 17-24-km-thick, extended continental crust. Gravity data suggest that this extended crust of similar thickness probably underlies the Ross Ice Shelf and Byrd Subglacial Basin. Various authors have estimated maximum late Cretaceous-present crustal extension in the West Antarctic rift area from 255-350 km based on balancing crustal thickness. Plate reconstruction allowed < 50 km of Tertiary extension. However, paleomagnetic measurements suggested about 1000 km of post-middle Cretaceous translation between East Antarctica and Pacific West Antarctica. Because a great amount of crustal extension in late Cenozoic time is unlikely, alternate mechanisms have been proposed for the late Cenozoic volcanism. Its vast volume and the ocean island basalt chemistry of the exposed late Cenozoic alkaline volcanic rocks were interpreted as evidence for a mantle plume head. An alternative or supplemental explanation to the mantle plume hypothesis is significantly greater lower lithosphere (mantle) stretching resulting in greater decompression melting than the limited Cenozoic crustal extension allows. Because of very slow rates of late Cenozoic extension in the West Antarctic Rift System, the amount of advected heat is small compared with the conductive heat. Therefore, phase transition probably would not explain the large subsidence with low extension observed in the West Antarctic Rift System. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {The hundredfold speedup in glacier motion in a surge of the kind the kind that took place in Variegated Glacier in 1982-1983 is caused by the buildup of high water pressure in the basal passageway system, which is made possible by a fundamental and pervasive change in the geometry and water-transport characteristics of this system. The behavior of the glacier in surge has many remarkable features, which can provide clues to a detailed theory of the surging process. The surge mechanism is akin to a proposed mechanism of overthrust faulting.},

Continuous deposition and climate-modulated deposition models are compared, and two physical models of the latter type are developed in detail. In addition to examining the sensitivity of the sequence of layer thicknesses to model type and threshold, parallels with terrestrial ocean margin deposition are drawn with a view to better understanding the effects of a prolonged interval of nondeposition on stratigraphy and the modification of the central polar stratigraphy by scarp margin effects. When the threshold for deposition lies in the midrange with respect to excursions of the climate function, deposition occurs about half of the time, and there is only a slight modulation of the layer thickness. When the threshold for deposition is high, deposition occurs only a small fraction of the total time, and groups of layers form which are separated from other groups by long periods of nondeposition.},

abstract = {Terrestrial laser scanning, or lidar, is a recent innovation in spatial information data acquisition, which allows geological outcrops to be digitally captured with unprecedented resolution and accuracy. With point precisions and spacing of the order of a few centimetres, an enhanced quantitative element can now be added to geological fieldwork and analysis, opening up new lines of investigation at a variety of scales in all areas of field-based geology. Integration with metric imagery allows 3D photorealistic models to be created for interpretation, visualization and education. However, gaining meaningful results from lidar scans requires more than simply acquiring raw point data. Surveys require planning and, typically, a large amount of postprocessing time. The contribution of this paper is to provide a more detailed insight into the technology, data collection and utilization techniques than is currently available. The paper focuses on the workflow for using lidar data, from the choice of field area and survey planning, to acquiring and processing data and, finally, extracting geologically useful data. Because manufacturer specifications for point precision are often optimistic when applied to real-world outcrops, the error sources associated with lidar data, and the implications of them propagating through the processing chain, are also discussed.},

abstract = {Abstract. The northern Antarctic Peninsula has recently exhibited ice-shelf disintegration, glacier recession and acceleration. However, the dynamic response of land-terminating, ice-shelf tributary and tidewater glaciers has not yet been quantified or assessed for variability, and there are sparse data for glacier classification, morphology, area, length or altitude. This paper firstly classifies the area, length, altitude, slope, aspect, geomorphology, type and hypsometry of 194 glaciers on Trinity Peninsula, Vega Island and James Ross Island in 2009 AD. Secondly, this paper documents glacier change 1988–2009. In 2009, the glacierised area was 8140±262 km2. From 1988–2001, 90{\%} of glaciers receded, and from 2001–2009, 79{\%} receded. This equates to an area change of −4.4{\%} for Trinity Peninsula eastern coast glaciers, −0.6{\%} for western coast glaciers, and −35.0{\%} for ice-shelf tributary glaciers from 1988–2001. Tidewater glaciers on the drier, cooler eastern Trinity Peninsula experienced fastest shrinkage from 1988–2001, with limited frontal change after 2001. Glaciers on the western Trinity Peninsula shrank less than those on the east. Land-terminating glaciers on James Ross Island shrank fastest in the period 1988–2001. This east-west difference is largely a result of orographic temperature and precipitation gradients across the Antarctic Peninsula, with warming temperatures affecting the precipitation-starved glaciers on the eastern coast more than on the western coast. Reduced shrinkage on the western Peninsula may be a result of higher snowfall, perhaps in conjunction with the fact that these glaciers are mostly grounded. Rates of area loss on the eastern side of Trinity Peninsula are slowing, which we attribute to the floating ice tongues receding into the fjords and reaching a new dynamic equilibrium. The rapid shrinkage of tidewater glaciers on James Ross Island is likely to continue because of their low elevations and flat profiles. In contrast, the higher and steeper tidewater glaciers on the eastern Antarctic Peninsula will attain more stable frontal positions after low-lying ablation areas are removed, reaching equilibrium more quickly.},

@article{Studinger2003,
abstract = {Lake Vostok, located beneath more than 4 km of ice in the middle of East Antarctica, is a unique subglacial habitat and may contain microorganisms with distinct adaptations to such an extreme environment. Melting and freezing at the base of the ice sheet, which slowly flows across the lake, controls the flux of water, biota and sediment particles through the lake. The influx of thermal energy, however, is limited to contributions from below. Thus the geological origin of Lake Vostok is a critical boundary condition for the subglacial ecosystem. We present the first comprehensive maps of ice surface, ice thickness and subglacial topography around Lake Vostok. The ice flow across the lake and the landscape setting are closely linked to the geological origin of Lake Vostok. Our data show that Lake Vostok is located along a major geological boundary. Magnetic and gravity data are distinct east and west of the lake, as is the roughness of the subglacial topography. The physiographic setting of the lake has important consequences for the ice flow and thus the melting and freezing pattern and the lake's circulation. Lake Vostok is a tectonically controlled subglacial lake. The tectonic processes provided the space for a unique habitat and recent minor tectonic activity could have the potential to introduce small, but significant amounts of thermal energy into the lake. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The first samples of high resolution Viking Orbiter topographic and stratigraphic data for the layered polar deposits of Mars are presented, showing that these deposits are with respect to both slopes and angular relief similar to those in the south. It is also demonstrated that, in conjunction with stereophotogrammetry, photoclinometry holds promise as a tool for detailed layered deposit studies. The spring season photography, which lends itself to photoclinometric analysis, covers the entire area of the north polar deposits. Detailed tests of layered terrain evolution hypotheses will be made, upon refinement of the data by comparison with stereo data. A more promising refining technique will make use of averaging perpendicular to selected sections to enhance SNR. Local reliefs of 200-800 m, and slopes of 1-8 deg, lead to initial calculations of average layer thickness which yields results of 14-46 m, linearly correlated with slope.},

abstract = {During the last interglacial period, 127–116 kyr ago, global mean sea level reached a peak of 5–9 mabove present-day sea level. However, the exact timing and magnitude of ice sheet collapse that contributed to the sea-level highstand is unclear. Here we explore this timing using stratigraphic and geomorphic mapping and uranium-series geochronology of fossil coral reefs and geophysical modelling of sea-level records fromWestern Australia.We show that between 127 and 119 kyr ago, eustatic sea level remained relatively stable at about 3–4m above present sea level. However, stratigraphically younger fossil corals with U-series ages of 118.1±1.4kyr are observed at elevations of up to 9.5mabove present mean sea level. Accounting for glacial isostatic adjustment and localized tectonics, we conclude that eustatic sea level rose to about 9mabove present at the end of the last interglacial.We suggest that in the last few thousand years of the interglacial, a critical ice sheet stability threshold was crossed, resulting in the catastrophic collapse of polar ice sheets and substantial sea-level rise.},

Two practical migration schemes utilizing this concept are developed in this paper. One scheme extends the Claerbout finite difference method, greatly reducing dispersion problems usually associated with this method at higher dips and frequencies. The second scheme effects a Fourier transform in both space and time; by using the full scalar wave equation in the conjugate space, the method eliminates (up to the aliasing frequency) dispersion altogether. The second method in particular appears adaptable to three-dimensional migration and migration before stack.},

abstract = {This paper describes the evolution of the control, navigation, and mapping capabilities of a hovering autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) designed to explore flooded cenotes in Mexico as part of the DEPTHX project. The vehicle is equipped with a suite of navigation sensors that allow it to localize itself and and create maps of the complex 3D environments in which it operates. It is passively stabilized in the roll and pitch directions and equipped with six thrusters that allow it to directly actuate each of the remaining degrees of freedom (x, y, z, and heading). We describe the control system of the vehicle, which provides open-water and near-wall manuevering capabilities. Near-wall behaviors are used in support of science operations such as visual wall survey and precise placement of a core sampling tool. We also present the vehicle’s navigation system, which combines dead-reckoning, sonar-based localization, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the performance of these systems using experimental results from multiple test environments, including a test tank, a flooded limestone quarry, and the La Pilita cenote. Trajectory plots comparing desired and actual motions will be used to demonstrate the various vehicle controllers. Data from repeated localization experiments will be used to provide statistically meaningful measures of the accuracy of the dead-reckoning, localization, and SLAM filters.},

@article{Behrendt1991,
abstract = {The Cenozoic West Antarctic rift system, characterized by Cenozoic bimodal alkalic volcanic rocks, extends over a largely ice-covered area, from the Ross Sea nearly to the Bellingshausen Sea. It is bounded on one side by a spectacular 4- to 5-km-high rift-shoulder scarp (maximum bedrock relief 5 to 7 km) from northern Victoria Land-Queen Maud Mountains to the Ellsworth-Whitmore-Horlick Mountains. Jurassic tholeiites crop out with the late Cenozoic volcanic rocks along the section of the Transantarctic Mountains from northern Victoria Land to the Horlick Mountains. The Cenozoic rift shoulder diverges here from the Jurassic tholeiite trend, and the tholeiites are exposed discontinuously along the lower elevation (1-2 km) section of the Transantarctic Mountains to the Weddell Sea.Various lines of evidence, no one of which is independently conclusive, lead us (as othershave also suggested) to interpret the following. The Transantarctic Mountains part of the rift shoulder (and probably the entire shoulder) has been rising since about 60 Ma, at episodic rates of ‚{\`{a}}º1 km/m.y., most recently since mid-Pliocene time, rather than continuously at the mean rate of 100 m/m.y. Uplift rates vary along the scarp, which is cut by transverse faults. We speculate that this uplift may have climatically forced the advance of the Antarctic ice sheet since the most recent warm period. We suggest a possible synergistic relation between episodic tectonism, mountain uplift, and volcanism in the Cenozoic West Antarctic rift system and waxing and waning of the Antarctic ice sheet beginning about earliest Oligocene time.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The tidal signal can either be discarded, or its characteristics described in some fashion useful for further analysis. Although tidal signals can be removed by standard high or bandpass filtering techniques, their relatively deterministic character and large amplitude make special techniques more effective. In classical harmonic analysis, the tidal signal is modelled as the sum of a finite set of sinusoids at specific frequencies related to astronomical parameters. A set of programs has been written in MATLAB to (a) perform classical harmonic analysis for periods of about 1 year or shorter, (b) account for (some) unresolved constituents using nodal corrections, and (c) compute confidence intervals for the analyzed components.},

Early systems functioned under close human supervision, effectively limited to executing preprogrammed tasks. However, as exploration moves to regions where communication is ineffective or unviable, robots will need to carry out complex tasks without human supervision. To enable such capabilities, robots are being enhanced by advances ranging from new sensor development to automated mission planning software, distributed robotic control, and more efficient power systems. As robotics technology becomes simultaneously more capable and economically viable, individual robots operated at large expense by teams of experts are increasingly supplemented by teams of robots used cooperatively under minimal human supervision.},

abstract = {A suite of sensors has been assembled to map surface elevation and topography with fine resolution from small unmanned aircraft systems. The sensor package consists of a light detecting and ranging (LIDAR) instrument, an inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Global Positioning System (GPS) module, and digital still and video cameras. The system has been utilized to map ice sheet topography in Greenland and to measure sea ice freeboard and roughness in Fram Strait off the coast of Svalbard and in the Southern Ocean near McMurdo, Antarctica. The elevation measurement accuracy is found to be <; 10 cm (1?) when short-baseline differential GPS processing is used to position the aircraft, and IMU data are used to correct for off-nadir pointing of the LIDAR. The system is optimized to provide coincident surface topography measurements and imagery of ice sheets, glaciers, and sea ice, and it has the potential to become a widely distributed observational resource to complement manned-aircraft and satellite missions.},

abstract = {Meltwater beneath the large ice sheets can influence ice flow by lubrication at the base or by softening when meltwater refreezes to form relatively warm ice. Refreezing has produced large basal ice units in East Antarctica. Bubble-free basal ice units also outcrop at the edge of the Greenland ice sheet, but the extent of refreezing and its influence on Greenland’s ice flow dynamics are unknown. Here we demonstrate that refreezing of meltwater produces distinct basal ice units throughout northern Greenland with thicknesses of up to 1,100 m. We compare airborne gravity data with modelled gravity anomalies to show that these basal units are ice. Using radar data we determine the extent of the units, which significantly disrupt the overlying ice sheet stratigraphy. The units consist of refrozen basal water commonly surrounded by heavily deformed meteoric ice derived from snowfall. We map these units along the ice sheet margins where surface melt is the largest source of water, as well as in the interior where basal melting is the only source of water. Beneath Petermann Glacier, basal units coincide with the onset of fast flow and channels in the floating ice tongue. We suggest that refreezing of meltwater and the resulting deformation of the surrounding basal ice warms the Greenland ice sheet, modifying the temperature structure of the ice column and influencing ice flow and grounding line melting.},

abstract = {A possible cause for accelerated thinning and break-up of floating marine ice shelves is warming of the water in the cavity below the ice shelf. Accurate bathymetry beneath large ice shelves is crucial for developing models of the ocean circulation in the sub-ice cavities. A grid of free-air gravity data over the floating Larsen C ice shelf collected during the Ice Bridge 2009 Antarctic campaign was utilized to develop the first bathymetry model of the underlying continental shelf. Independent control on the continental shelf geologic structures from marine surveys was used to constrain the inversion. Depths on the continental shelf beneath the ice shelf estimated from the inversion generally range from about 350 to 650 m, but vary from 1000 m. Localized overdeepenings, 20-30 km long and 900-1000 m deep, are located in inlets just seaward of the grounding line. Submarine valleys extending seaward from the overdeepenings coalesce into two broad troughs that extend to the seaward limit of the ice shelf and appear to extend to the edge of the continental shelf. The troughs are generally at a depth of 550-700 m although the southernmost mapped trough deepens to over 1000 m near the edge of the ice shelf just south of 68 S. The combination of the newly determined bathymetry with published ice-draft determinations based on laser altimetry and radar data defines the geometry of the water-filled cavity. These newly imaged troughs provide a conduit for water to traverse the continental shelf and interact with the overlying Larsen C ice shelf and the grounding lines of the outlet glaciers.},

abstract = {Airborne gravimetry has played a vital role in contributing to our knowledge of the subglacial environment in polar regions. Previous programs have produced extensive gravity data sets in Antarctica, but the resolution and accuracy of the data have been limited. We have evaluated the relative performance and suitability of two different airborne gravimeters for research applications from flight tests over the Canadian Rocky Mountains near Calgary. Survey design, mission profiles, and demands on the performance of an airborne gravimeter are different for the remote polar environment than for most commercial exploration surveys. Both systems, the AIRGrav and GT-1A, can produce higher-resolution data with improved flight efficiency than can the BGM-3 and LaCoste {\&} Romberg gravimeters used in Antarctica. The AIRGrav and GT-1A systems are capable of draped flying of airborne gravity, allowing new applications for polar use. Both systems could provide the academic community with a significant increase in accuracy and horizontal resolution to enable major advances in understanding the subglacial environment. Compared to the GT-1A system, the AIRGrav system has a lower noise level and higher accuracy, and it is less sensitive to changing flight conditions - in particular, vertical accelerations during turbulent flights.},

abstract = {Knowledge of iceberg calving is important for understanding instabilities of tidewater glaciers and ice sheets. Since 1995 the terminus of LeConte Glacier, Alaska, U. S. A., has retreated about 2 km and the glacier has thinned approximately 120 m at its 1999 terminus position. Our focus is short-term (hours to weeks) variability of the frequency and magnitude of calving events and calving flux. Both photogrammetric and visual observations are employed in a temporal analysis over a several-week period. We combined these data with measurements of ice speed, tide level, surface water input and water-storage estimates in an attempt to better understand the calving process. Contrary to results obtained over longer time-scales on other glaciers, our results show no correlation between ice speed and the frequency of calving. However, calving events do not appear to occur randomly; often they are a response to measurable changes in other parameters within the terminus region. Caclving can often be attributed to buoyancy perturbations and possibly flexure of the nearly floating terminus. Given the multiple possibilities for buoyancy perturbations, we have found no simple relationship between any specific forcing parameter and calving at short time-scales.},

@article{Moholdt2010,
abstract = {We have tested three methods for estimating 2003-2008 elevation changes of Svalbard glaciers from multi-temporal ICESat laser altimetry: (a) linear interpolation of crossover points between ascending and descending tracks, (b) projection of near repeat-tracks onto common locations using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and (c) least-squares fitting of rigid planes to segments of repeat-track data assuming a constant elevation change rate. The two repeat-track methods yield similar results and compare well to the more accurate, but sparsely sampled, crossover points. Most glacier regions in Svalbard have experienced low-elevation thinning combined with high-elevation balance or thickening during 2003-2008. The geodetic mass balance (excluding calving front retreat or advance) of Svalbard's 34,600km2 glaciers is estimated to be -4.3??1.4 Gt y-1, corresponding to an area-averaged water equivalent (w.e.) balance of -0.12??0.04m w.e. y-1. The largest ice losses have occurred in the west and south, while northeastern Spitsbergen and the Austfonna ice cap have gained mass. Winter and summer elevation changes derived from the same methods indicate that the spatial gradient in mass balance is mainly due to a larger summer season thinning in the west and the south than in the northeast. Our findings are consistent with in-situ mass balance measurements from the same period, confirming that repeat-track satellite altimetry can be a valuable tool for monitoring short term elevation changes of Arctic glaciers. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We present newly acquired airborne radar data showing ice thickness and surface elevation for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. These data, when combined with earlier measurements, suggest the presence of a lightly grounded area immediately above the grounding line of Pine Island Glacier. We identify this region as an "ice plains" It lies close to the centre line of the glacier, has an elevation above buoyancy of < 50 m and extends inland for > 28 km. The upstream edge of the ice plain is defined by a "coupling line". The configuration of the ice plain implies that nearby thinning of the ice stream would result in substantial grounding-line retreat. We suggest that the grounding-line retreat of Pine Island Glacier, observed between 1992 and 1996, probably commenced sometime after 1981.},

abstract = {A model of the dynamics and thermodynamics of a plume of meltwater at the base of an ice shelf is presented. Such ice shelf water plumes may become supercooled and deposit marine ice if they rise (because of the pressure decrease in the in situ freezing temperature), so the model incorporates both melting and freezing at the ice shelf base and a multiple-size-class model of frazil ice dynamics and deposition. The plume is considered in two horizontal dimensions, so the influence of Coriolis forces is incorporated for the first time. It is found that rotation is extremely influential, with simulated plumes flowing in near-geostrophy because of the low friction at a smooth ice shelf base. As a result, an ice shelf water plume will only rise and become supercooled (and thus deposit marine ice) if it is constrained to flow upslope by topography. This result agrees with the observed distribution of marine ice under Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, Antarctica. In addition, it is found that the model only produces reasonable marine ice formation rates when an accurate ice shelf draft is used, implying that the characteristics of real ice shelf water plumes can only be captured using models with both rotation and a realistic topography.},

abstract = {Airborne gravimetry has become an important geophysical tool primarily because of advancements in methodology and instrumentation made in the past decade. Airbome gravity is especially useful when measured in conjunction with other geophysical data, such as magnetics, radar, and laser altimetry. The aerogeophysical survey over the West Antarctic ice sheet described in this paper is one such interdisciplinary study. This paper outlines in detail the instrumentation, survey and data processing methodology employed to perform airborne gravimetry from the multi-instrumented Twin Otter aircraft. Precise positioning from carrier-phase Global Positioning System (GPS) observations are combined with measurements of acceleration made by the gravity meter in the aircraft to obtain the free-air gravity anomaly measurement at aircraft altitude. GPS data are processed using the Kinematic and Rapid Static (KARS) software program, and aircraft vertical acceleration and corrections for gravity data reduction are calculated from the GPS position solution. Accuracies for the free-air anomaly are determined from crossover analysis after significant editing (2.98 mGal rms) and from a repeat track (1.39 mGal rms). The aerogeophysical survey covered a 300,000 km(2) region in West Antarctica over the course of five field seasons. The gravity data from the West Antarctic survey reveal the major geologic structures of the West Antarctic rift system, including the Whitmore Mountains, the Byrd Subglacial Basin, the Sinuous Ridge, the Ross Embayment, and Siple Dome. These measurements, in conjunction with magnetics and ice- penetrating radar, provide the information required to reveal the tectonic fabric and history of this important region.},

abstract = {Ice sheet thickness is determined mainly by the strength of ice-bed$\backslash$ncoupling that controls holistic transitions from slow sheet flow$\backslash$nto fast streamflow to buttressing shelf flow. Byrd Glacier has the$\backslash$nlargest ice drainage system in Antarctica and is the fastest ice$\backslash$nstream entering Ross Ice Shelf. In 2004 two large subglacial lakes$\backslash$nat the head of Byrd Glacier suddenly drained and increased the terminal$\backslash$nice velocity of Byrd Glacier from 820 m yr(-1) to 900 m yr(-1). This$\backslash$nresulted in partial ice-bed recoupling above the lakes and partial$\backslash$ndecoupling along Byrd Glacier. An attempt to quantify this behavior$\backslash$nis made using flowband and flowline models in which the controlling$\backslash$nvariable for ice height above the bed is the floating fraction phi$\backslash$nof ice along the flowband and flowline. Changes in phi before and$\backslash$nafter drainage are obtained from available data, but more reliable$\backslash$ndata in the map plane are required before Byrd Glacier can be modeled$\backslash$nadequately. A holistic sliding velocity is derived that depends on$\backslash$nphi, with contributions from ice shearing over coupled beds and ice$\backslash$nstretching over uncoupled beds, as is done in state-of-the-art sliding$\backslash$ntheories.},

abstract = {Local maxima of the horizontal gradient of pseudogravity from closely spaced aeromagnetic surveys over the Ross Sea, northwestern Ross Ice Shelf, and the West Antarctic ice sheet, reveal a linear magnetic rift fabric and numerous subcircular, high-amplitude anomalies, Most of these anomalies have sources that probably resulted from late Cenozoic volcanism, Some of these volcanic structures penetrate the Neogene sediments beneath the deglaciated continental shelf and are present at the base of the present grounded ice sheet and beneath the ice shelf, Geophysical data indicate two or three youthful volcanic edifices at widely separated areas beneath the sea and ice cover in the West Antarctic rift system. In contrast, we suggest glacial removal of edifices of volcanic sources of many more anomalies, Magnetic models, controlled by marine seismic reflection and radar ice-sounding data, allow us to infer that glacial removal of the associated late Cenozoic volcanic edifices (probably debris, comprising pillow breccias, and hyaloclastites) has occurred essentially concomitantly with their subglacial eruption, ''Removal'' of unconsolidated volcanic debris erupted beneath the ice is probably a more appropriate term than ''erosion,'' given its fragmented, ice- contact origin, The exposed volcanoes may have been protected from erosion by the surrounding ice sheet because of more competent rock or high elevation above the ice sheet, Glacial removal may be the general case; exposed late Cenozoic volcanic peaks and outcrops, consisting primarily of flows, which erupted during Antarctic glacial conditions since similar to 30 Ma, may be the exceptions, The volume of the exposed volcanoes is small in contrast to the much greater volume (>10(6) km(3)) of late Cenozoic magmatic rock remaining at volcanic centers beneath the continental shelf, Ross Ice Shelf, and West Antarctic ice sheet.},

abstract = {Chemical and biological sensor technologies have advanced rapidly in the past five years. Sensors that require low power and operate for multiple years are now available for oxygen, nitrate, and a variety of bio-optical properties that serve as proxies for important components of the carbon cycle (e.g., particulate organic carbon). These sensors have all been deployed successfully for long periods, in some cases more than three years, on platforms such as profiling floats or gliders. Technologies for pH, pCO2, and particulate inorganic carbon are maturing rapidly as well. These sensors could serve as the enabling technology for a global biogeochemical observing system that might operate on a scale comparable to the current Argo array. Here, we review the scientific motivation and the prospects for a global observing system for ocean biogeochemistry. - See more at: http://www.tos.org/oceanography/archive/22-3{\_}johnson.html{\#}citation},

abstract = {The spatial distribution of accumulation across Siple Dome, West Antarctica, is determined from analysis of the shapes of internal layers detected by radio-echo sounding (RES) measurements. A range of assumed accumulation patterns is used in an ice-flow model to calculate a set of internal layer patterns. Inverse techniques are used to determine which assumed accumulation pattern produces a calculated internal layer pattern that best matches the shape of internal layers from RES measurements. All of the observed internal layer shapes at Siple Dome can be matched using a spatially asymmetric accumulation pattern which has been steady over time. Relative to the divide, the best-fitting accumulation pattern-predicts 40{\%} less accumulation 30 km from the divide on the south flank of Siple Dome and 15-40{\%} more accumulation 30 km from the divide on the north flank. The data also allow the possibility for a small time variation of the pattern north of the divide. The mismatch between the calculated and the observed layer shapes is slightly reduced when the accumulation rate north of the divide is higher in the past (>5 kyr BP) than at present. Sensitivity tests show that the predicted change in the spatial accumulation pattern required to cause the slight Siple Dome divide migration (inferred from previous studies) would be detectable in the internal layer pattern if it persisted for >2 kyr. Our analysis reveals no evidence that such a change has occurred, and the possible change in accumulation distribution allowed by the data is in the opposite sense. Therefore, it is unlikely that the Siple Dome divide migration has been caused by a temporal change in the spatial pattern of accumulation. This conclusion suggests the migration may be caused by elevation changes in Ice Streams C and D at the boundaries of Siple Dome. (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)},

The method is analytical and based upon the stream function and its vertically normalized form, the normalized stream function (NSF). We show that the slope of the isochrones is the slope of the iso-NSF lines, plus a path term which is the cumulative result of the past trajectory of the ice particles. We illustrate this path term in three different examples: varying basal melting, varying basal sliding (Weertman effect) and varying velocity profile around a divide (Raymond effect). The path term generally counteracts the slope of the iso-NSF lines. In the case of the Raymond effect, it can even lead to depressions surrounding the bumps if the transition from dome to flank velocity profile is sufficiently abrupt.},

abstract = {Jakobshavn Isbrae, West Greenland, underwent a large, rapid and not well understood change in flow dynamics in 1998, leading to a doubling of its ice discharge rates. We calculate the width-averaged forces controlling flow of Jakobshavn Isbrae in 1995, 2000 and 2005 to elucidate processes responsible for this change in flow speed. In contrast to earlier suggestions, we conclude that the observed acceleration was not caused by the loss of back-stress due to weakening and subsequent break-up of the floating ice tongue alone. Gradients in longitudinal stress are small at all times considered (∼3{\%} of the driving stress) and basal and lateral drag provide resistance to flow. Over the 10 year period considered, the average driving stress increased by 20 kPa, which was balanced by a comparable increase in lateral drag. We surmise that the velocity changes resulted from weakening of the ice in the lateral shear margins and perhaps a change in properties at the bed. Possible mechanisms for weakening of ice in the lateral shear margins include cryo-hydrologic warming of subsurface ice in the ablation zone and hydraulic weakening due to higher water content of ice in the shear margins.},

abstract = {The response of ice streams to ocean tides is investigated. Numerical modelling experiments are conducted using a two-dimensional flow-line model of coupled ice-stream and ice-shelf flow. The model includes all components of the equilibrium equations, and uses a non-linear viscoelastic constitutive equation for ice. Basal sliding is simulated with a Weertman type sliding law where basal sliding is proportional to some power of the basal shear stress. The response of ice-streams to tidal forcing is found to be profoundly affected by mechanical conditions at the bed. For a non-linear sliding law, a non-linear interaction between the two main semi-diurnal tidal constituents (M2 and S2) can give rise to a significant perturbation in ice-stream flow at the lunisolar synodic fortnightly (MSf) tidal period of 14.76 days. For a linear sliding law, in contrast, no such modulation in flow at the MSf frequency is found. For vertical ocean tides of the type observed on Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf (FRIS), the amplitude of the horizontal modulation in ice-stream flow at the MSf frequency resulting from a non-linear interaction between the S2 and M2 tidal constitutes can be larger than the direct response at the S2 and the M2 frequencies. In comparison the non-linear interaction between K1 and O1 tidal components is weak. As a consequence, modelled ice-stream response to mixed oceanic tides of the type found on FRIS is stronger at the MSf period of 14.76 days than at both the semi-diurnal and diurnal frequencies, while at the same time almost absent at the similar Mf period of 13.66 days. The model results compare favourably with measurements of tidally induced flow variations on Rutford Ice Stream (RIS), West Antarctica. On RIS a strong tidal response is found at the MSf frequency with a smaller response at the semi-diurnal and diurnal frequencies, and almost no response at the Mf frequency. A non-linear viscous sliding law appears to have the potential to fully explain these observations.},

abstract = {The Board of inquiry into the loss of Autosub2 under the Fimbulisen found that the loss was caused by a technical systems failure on the AUV. A comprehensive analysis was made of the technical reasons for the loss. However, because it was not possible to recover the AUV from under the ice shelf for direct examination, it was not possible to identify the actual cause of loss. Consequently an assessment was made of the likelihood of different failure modes causing the loss. The results of this analysis suggest that the loss was equally likely to have come about from an Abort Command (AC) as a Loss of Power (LP). A root cause analysis was performed which indicated that the source of the failure was most likely to have been a fault introduced during the manufacturing/assembly phase (52{\%}), followed by Maintenance (25{\%}). Design error was considered less likely (14{\%}) while Operations (7{\%}) and External factors (1{\%}) were considered least likely. This analysis indicates that the greatest benefits to reliability improvements are most likely to come from attention to faults originating in the manufacturing and assembly stage, followed by attention to faults arising from maintenance activities. Due to the large numbers of connections and leakage paths, it is necessary to pay particular attention to the reliability of electrical connectors and harnesses. A high level of quality assurance in manufacture and assembly is required to achieve an acceptable level of system reliability. While it was accepted that the development team at NOC had adopted sound engineering practices in the development of the AUV and that reliability considerations had informed design decisions, the design team had no formally implemented reliability or technical risk assessment procedures to support design decision making. This was considered to be a major management weakness.},

abstract = {Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica, has been experiencing acceleration in its flow speed and mass loss for nearly two decades, driven in part by an increase in the delivery of relatively warm Circumpolar DeepWater (CDW). However, at present, the configuration of the sub-ice-shelf cavity and bed conditions beneath the PIG ice shelf that dictate such oceanic influences remain poorly understood. Here, we use aerogravity data and ocean bottom depths measured by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to model the bathymetry and sediment layer thickness beneath the PIG ice shelf. Results reveal that the deep basins, previously found by AUVon both landward and seaward sides of a submarine ridge, extend substantially to the north and south. The water column thickness of the basins reaches 400–550m on the landward side of the ridge and 500–600m on the seaward side. The sediment layer covers the whole expanse of the seabed beneath the ice shelf, and the thickness is in the range 200–1000m. The thinnest sediments (<200m) are found on the seaward slope of the submarine ridge, suggesting that erosion by advancing ice may have been concentrated in the lee of the topographic high.},

abstract = {<p>The Antarctic Ice Sheet is the largest potential source of future sea-level rise. Mass loss has been increasing over the last 2 decades for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) but with significant discrepancies between estimates, especially for the Antarctic Peninsula. Most of these estimates utilise geophysical models to explicitly correct the observations for (unobserved) processes. Systematic errors in these models introduce biases in the results which are difficult to quantify. In this study, we provide a statistically rigorous error-bounded trend estimate of ice mass loss over the WAIS from 2003 to 2009 which is almost entirely data driven. Using altimetry, gravimetry, and GPS data in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we derive spatial fields for ice mass change, surface mass balance, and glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) without relying explicitly on forward models. The approach we use separates mass and height change contributions from different processes, reproducing spatial features found in, for example, regional climate and GIA forward models, and provides an independent estimate which can be used to validate and test the models. In addition, spatial error estimates are derived for each field. The mass loss estimates we obtain are smaller than some recent results, with a time-averaged mean rate of −76 ± 15 Gt yr<sup>−1</sup> for the WAIS and Antarctic Peninsula, including the major Antarctic islands. The GIA estimate compares well with results obtained from recent forward models (IJ05-R2) and inverse methods (AGE-1). The Bayesian framework is sufficiently flexible that it can, eventually, be used for the whole of Antarctica, be adapted for other ice sheets and utilise data from other sources such as ice cores, accumulation radar data, and other measurements that contain information about any of the processes that are solved for.</p>},

abstract = {Recent estimates of Antarctica's present-day rate of ice-mass contribution to changes in sea level range from 31 gigatonnes a year (Gt yr(-1); ref. 1) to 246 Gt yr(-1) (ref. 2), a range that cannot be reconciled within formal errors. Time-varying rates of mass loss contribute to this, but substantial technique-specific systematic errors also exist. In particular, estimates of secular ice-mass change derived from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data are dominated by significant uncertainty in the accuracy of models of mass change due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Here we adopt a new model of GIA, developed from geological constraints, which produces GIA rates systematically lower than those of previous models, and an improved fit to independent uplift data. After applying the model to 99 months (from August 2002 to December 2010) of GRACE data, we estimate a continent-wide ice-mass change of -69 ± 18 Gt yr(-1) (+0.19 ± 0.05 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). This is about a third to a half of the most recently published GRACE estimates, which cover a similar time period but are based on older GIA models. Plausible GIA model uncertainties, and errors relating to removing longitudinal GRACE artefacts ('destriping'), confine our estimate to the range -126 Gt yr(-1) to -29 Gt yr(-1) (0.08-0.35 mm yr(-1) sea-level equivalent). We resolve 26 independent drainage basins and find that Antarctic mass loss, and its acceleration, is concentrated in basins along the Amundsen Sea coast. Outside this region, we find that West Antarctica is nearly in balance and that East Antarctica is gaining substantial mass.},

abstract = {Effective observation and continual monitoring of a dynamic ocean environment cannot be done with a single fixed instrument. A collection of static and mobile sensors must be deployed, and the acquired data must be distributed to all members of the team. Successfully orchestrating a multi-sensor, long-term deployment additionally requires a robust, rapid and cost-effective communication network. Only when all these components are in synchronous operation can scientists begin to improve our overall understanding of the complex ocean environment. CINAPS is the Center for Integrated Networked Aquatic PlatformS located at the University of Southern California, with the intent to bridge the gap between technology, communication, and the scientific exploration of local and regional aquatic ecosystems. To accomplish this task, CINAPS has designed and deployed an embedded sensor network to monitor and observe the coastal regions of Southern California. In this article, we present the recent developments of the CINAPS system with the goal of developing an improved understanding of harmful algal blooms via the biological processes and the dynamics of the organisms carrying out these processes.},

abstract = {Recent observations of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet document rapid changes in the mass balance of its component glaciers. These observations raise the question of whether changing climatic conditions have triggered a dynamical instability in the ice-sheet - ice-shelf system. The dynamics of marine ice sheets are sensitive to grounding-line position and variation, characteristics that are poorly captured by most current models. We present a theory for grounding-line dynamics in three spatial dimensions and time. Our theory is based on a balance of forces across the grounding line; it is expressed as a differential equation that is analogous to the canonical Stefan condition. We apply this theory to the question of grounding-line stability under conditions of retrograde bed slope in a suite of calculations with different basal topography. A subset of these have basal topography inspired by the Pine Island glacier, where basal depth varies in both the along-flow and across-flow directions. Our results indicate that unstable retreat of the grounding line over retrograde beds is a robust feature of models that evolve based on force balance at the grounding line. We conclude, based on our simplified model, that unstable grounding-line recession may already be occurring at the Pine Island glacier.},

abstract = {<p>The tidal forcing of ice streams at their ocean boundary can serve as a natural experiment to gain an insight into their dynamics and constrain the basal sliding law. A nonlinear 3-D viscoelastic full Stokes model of coupled ice stream ice shelf flow is used to investigate the response of ice streams to ocean tides. In agreement with previous results based on flow-line modelling and with a fixed grounding line position, we find that a nonlinear basal sliding law can qualitatively reproduce long-period modulation of tidal forcing found in field observations. In addition, we show that the inclusion of lateral drag, or allowing the grounding line to migrate over the tidal cycle, does not affect these conclusions. Further analysis of modelled ice stream flow shows a varying stress-coupling length scale of boundary effects upstream of the grounding line. We derive a viscoelastic stress-coupling length scale from ice stream equations that depends on the forcing period and closely agrees with model output.</p>},
